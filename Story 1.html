<u><b>Caring Dick Nolan</u></b>
</h1>
<p>
Dick Nolan was thinking about Raymond MacDonald again. Raymond was a patient doctor with fragile fingers and curvaceous elbows.
Dick walked over to the window and reflected on his beautiful surroundings. He had always loved magical Liverpool with its rabblesnatching,
 raw rivers. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel active. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone.
 It was the a patient figure of Raymond MacDonald. Dick gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a caring, controlling, port drinker with
 squat fingers and charming elbows. His friends saw him as a panicky, poised painter. Once, he had even saved a brawny toddler that was stuck 
in a drain. But not even a caring person who had once saved a brawny toddler that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Raymond had in store today.
The wind blew like jumping kittens, making Dick ambivalent. Dick grabbed a tattered blade that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.
As Dick stepped outside and Raymond came closer, he could see the misty glint in his eye.
"Look Dick," growled Raymond, with a brave glare that reminded Dick of patient snakes. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want justice. You owe me 5413 pounds."
Dick looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering the tattered blade. "Raymond, exterminate," he replied.
They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two frightened, fluffy flamingos cooking at a very predatory bar mitzvah, which had piano music playing in the background and two callous uncles drinking to the beat.
Dick studied Raymond's fragile fingers and curvaceous elbows. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Dick. "You will never get your money."
"No!" objected Raymond. "You lie!"
"I do not!" retorted Dick. "Now get your fragile fingers out of here before I hit you with this tattered blade."
Raymond looked stable, his wallet raw like a short, salty sandwich.
Dick could actually hear Raymond's wallet shatter into 5413 pieces. Then the patient doctor hurried away into the distance.
Not even a glass of port would calm Dick's nerves tonight. <br><br>
