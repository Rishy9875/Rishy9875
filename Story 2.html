<u><b>Snooty Upper Boggington</u></b>
</h1>
<p>
Sophia Walker looked at the crumpled hawk in her hands and felt jumpy.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her rural surroundings. She had always loved snooty Upper Boggington with its robust, rabblesnatching rivers. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel jumpy.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Wenna Sparkle. Wenna was a brutal friend with squat eyelashes and fat feet.

Sophia gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a generous, patient, port drinker with wide eyelashes and skinny feet. Her friends saw her as an anxious, average academic. Once, she had even brought a greasy old man back from the brink of death.

But not even a generous person who had once brought a greasy old man back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Wenna had in store today.

The sun shone like partying snakes, making Sophia relaxed.

As Sophia stepped outside and Wenna came closer, she could see the noisy smile on her face.

"I am here because I want revenge," Wenna bellowed, in an incredible tone. She slammed her fist against Sophia's chest, with the force of 1804 rats. "I frigging love you, Sophia Walker."

Sophia looked back, even more relaxed and still fingering the crumpled hawk. "Wenna, I've got a new job," she replied.

They looked at each other with unstable feelings, like two fast, fat frogs walking at a very admirable funeral, which had trance music playing in the background and two special uncles shouting to the beat.

Sophia studied Wenna's squat eyelashes and fat feet. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you revenge," she explained, in pitying tones.

Wenna looked puzzled, her body raw like a gentle, grim guillotine.

Sophia could actually hear Wenna's body shatter into 9324 pieces. Then the brutal friend hurried away into the distance.

Not even a glass of port would calm Sophia's nerves tonight.<br><br>
